My website name : fast-rider-official

Some Feature of this site: 

1. It is a react authentication site with login form validation, privateRoute and other simple route.

2. Here I added total seven component.

3. I used Private route for destination component and it will only show when someone is logged In.

4. I make some fakeData for use home component rider with image title and id

5. Use Bootstrap for design and also used react hook form in destination form.

6. If going in destination route without selection ride option then it will not show destination card after searching.

7. Added google map by iframe, it works properly.
